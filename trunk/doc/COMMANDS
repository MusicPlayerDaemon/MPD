                         Music Player Daemon - Commands

                                    WARNING
	This document has not been updated to reflect recent changes in
	the MPD protocol.  It does not contain all supported commands,
	and some commands may now take additional arguments.  However,
	clients conforming to this specification should still be
	compatible with the latest release of MPD.  For more up to date
	documentation, please see the protocol reference on the wiki at
	<http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Protocol_Reference>.

This document is intended for client developers, not end users.

Format:
-------

If arguments contain spaces, they should be surrounded by double quotation 
marks, ".  

command <type arg1> <type arg2> ...
	explanation: w/ arg1 and arg2

All data between the client and server is encoded in UTF-8. (Note,
that in UTF-8 all standard ansi characters, 0-127, are the same as a standard
ansi encoding. Also, no ansi character appears in any multi-byte
characters.  So, you can use standard C functions like strlen, and strcpy
just fine with UTF-8 encoded strings. For example: "OK\n" encoded in UTF-8 is
simply "OK\n".  For more information on UTF=8: 
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html#utf-8 )

Command Completion:
-------------------

A command returns "OK\n" on completion or "ACK some error\n" on failure.
These denote the end of command execution.

NOTE:
-----

For manipulating playlists and playing, there are two sets of commands.  One
set uses the song id of a song in the playlist, while another set uses the
playlist position of the song.  The commands using song id's should be used
instead of the commands that manipulate and control playback based on playlist
position.  Using song id's is a safer method when multiple clients are 
interacting with MPD.

Commands:
---------

add <string path>
	add the file _path_ to the playlist (directories add recursively)
	_path_ can also be a single file
	increments playlist version by for each song added

next
	plays next song in playlist

pause	<bool pause>
	toggle pause/resume playing
	_pause_ is required and should be 0 or 1

plchanges <playlist version>
	displays changed songs currently in the playlist since

	NOTE: to detect songs that were deleted at the end of the playlist,
	use playlistlength returned by status command.

plchangesposid <playlist version>
	displays changed songs currently in the playlist since 
	_playlist version_
	This function only returns the position and the id of the changed song, not the complete metadata. This is more bandwidth efficient.

	NOTE: To update a number of paths/songs at once, use command_list,

	command_list for updating, only one update_db job id will be returned
	per sequence of updates.

volume <int change>
	change volume by amount _change_

COMMAND LIST
------------

To facilitate faster adding of files, etc, you can pass a list of commands all
at once using a command list.  The command list beings with:

command_list_begin

or:

command_list_ok_begin

And ends with:

command_list_end

It does not execute any commands until the list has ended.  The return
value is whatever the return for a list of commands is.  On success
for all commands, OK is returned.  If a command fails, no more commands
are executed and the appropriate ACK error is returned. If "command_list_ok_begin is used", "list_OK\n" is returned for each successful command executed
in the command list.
