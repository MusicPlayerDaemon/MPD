 * The player thread controls the playback.  It acts as a bridge

 * #MusicChunk objects from the decoder, optionally mixes them
 * (cross-fading), applies software volume, and sends them to the
 * audio outputs via PlayerOutputs::Play()
 * (i.e. MultipleOutputs::Play()).
 *
 * It is controlled by the main thread (the playlist code), see
 * Control.hxx.  The playlist enqueues new songs into the player
 * thread and sends it commands.
 *
 * The player thread itself does not do any I/O.  It synchronizes with
 * other threads via #GMutex and #GCond objects, and passes
 * #MusicChunk instances around in #MusicPipe objects.
