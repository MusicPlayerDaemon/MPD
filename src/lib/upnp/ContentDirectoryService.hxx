 * Content Directory Service class.

 * the directory, using libupnp for handling the UPnP protocols.
 *
 * Note: m_rdreqcnt: number of entries requested per directory read.
 * 0 means all entries. The device can still return less entries than
 * requested, depending on its own limits. In general it's not optimal
 * becauses it triggers issues, and is sometimes actually slower, e.g. on
 * a D-Link NAS 327
 *
 * The value chosen may affect by the UpnpSetMaxContentLength
 * (2000*1024) done during initialization, but this should be ample
