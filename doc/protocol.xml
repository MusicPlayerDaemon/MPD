      <title>Protocol overview</title>

      <para>
        The <application>MPD</application> command protocol exchanges
        line-based text records between client and server over TCP.
        Once the client is connected to the server, they conduct a
        conversation until the client closes the connection. The
        conversation flow is always initiated by the client.
      </para>

      <para>
        The client transmits a command sequence, terminated by the
        newline character <constant>\n</constant>.  The server will
        respond with one or more lines, the last of which will be a
        completion code.
      </para>

      <para>
        When the client connects to the server, the server will answer
        with the following line:

        <synopsis>OK MPD version</synopsis>

        where <varname>version</varname> is a version identifier such as
        0.12.2.  This version identifier is the version of the protocol
        spoken, not the real version of the daemon.  (There is no way to
        retrieve this real version identifier from the connection.)

        arguments by linear white-space (' ' or '\t').

        A command returns <returnvalue>OK</returnvalue> on completion or
        <returnvalue>ACK some error</returnvalue> on failure.  These
        denote the end of command execution.

        <title>Failure responses</title>

        <para>
          The nature of the error can be gleaned from the information
          that follows the <returnvalue>ACK</returnvalue>.
          <returnvalue>ACK</returnvalue> lines are of the form:

          <synopsis>ACK [error@command_listNum] {current_command} message_text\n</synopsis>

          These responses are generated by a call to
          <function>commandError</function>. They contain four separate
          terms. Let's look at each of them:

                An error will always cause a command list to terminate
                at the command that causes the error.

            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                <returnvalue>current_command</returnvalue>:
                name of the command, in a <link
                  linkend="command_lists">Command List</link>,
                that was executing when the error occurred.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                <returnvalue>message_text</returnvalue>:
                some (hopefully) informative text that describes the
                nature of the error.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <example>
          <title>foo</title>
          <para>
            An example might help. Consider the following sequence
            sent from the client to the server.

            <synopsis>
              command_list_begin
              volume 86
              play 10240
              status
              command_list_end
            </synopsis>
          </para>

          <para>
            The server responds with:

            <returnvalue>
              ACK [50@1] {play} song doesn't exist: "10240"
            </returnvalue>
          </para>

          <para>
            This tells us that the play command, which was the
            second in the list (the first or only command is
            numbered 0), failed with error 50.  The number 50
            translates to <constant>ACK_ERROR_NO_EXIST</constant>--the
            song doesn't exist.  This is reiterated by the message text
            which also tells us which song doesn't exist.
          </para>

        </example>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="command_lists">
      <title>Command lists</title>

      <para>
        To facilitate faster adding of files etc. you can pass a list
        of commands all at once using a command list.  The command
        list begins with <command>command_list_begin</command> or
        <command>command_list_ok_begin</command> and ends with
        <command>command_list_end</command>.
      </para>

      <para>
        It does not execute any commands until the list has ended.
        The return value is whatever the return for a list of commands
        is.  On success for all commands,
        <returnvalue>OK</returnvalue> is returned.  If a command
        fails, no more commands are executed and the appropriate
        <returnvalue>ACK</returnvalue> error is returned. If
        <command>command_list_ok_begin</command> is used,
        <returnvalue>list_OK</returnvalue> is returned for each
        successful command executed in the command list.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="range_syntax">
      <title>Ranges</title>

      <para>
        Some commands (e.g. <link
        linkend="command_delete"><command>delete</command></link>)
        allow specifying a range in the form
        <parameter>START:END</parameter> (the <varname>END</varname>
        item is not included in the range, similar to ranges in the
        Python programming language).  If <varname>END</varname> is
        omitted, then the maximum possible value is assumed.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="filter_syntax">
      <title>Filters</title>

      <para>
        All commands which search for songs (e.g. <link

          <para>
            <varname>VALUE</varname> is what to find.  The

      <title>Queuing</title>

      <para>
        Often, users run <application>MPD</application> with "<link
        linkend="command_random">random</link>" enabled, but want to
        be able to insert songs "before" the rest of the playlist.
        That is commonly called "queuing".
      </para>

      <para>
        <application>MPD</application> implements this by allowing the client to specify a
        "priority" for each song in the playlist (commands <link
        linkend="command_prio"><command>prio</command></link> and
        <link
        linkend="command_prioid"><command>prioid</command></link>).  A
        higher priority means that the song is going to be played
        before the other songs.
      </para>

      <para>
        In "random" mode, <application>MPD</application> maintains an
        internal randomized sequence of songs.  In this sequence,
        songs with a higher priority come first, and all songs with
        the same priority are shuffled (by default, all songs are
        shuffled, because all have the same priority "0").  When you
        increase the priority of a song, it is moved to the front of
        the sequence according to its new priority, but always after
        the current one.  A song that has been played already (it's
        "before" the current song in that sequence) will only be
        scheduled for repeated playback if its priority has become
        bigger than the priority of the current song.  Decreasing the
        priority of a song will move it farther to the end of the
        sequence.  Changing the priority of the current song has no
        effect on the sequence.  During playback, a song's priority is
        reset to zero.

    <note>
      <para>
        For manipulating playlists and playing, there are two sets of
        commands.  One set uses the song id of a song in the playlist,
        while another set uses the playlist position of the song. The
        commands using song ids should be used instead of the commands
        that manipulate and control playback based on playlist
        position. Using song ids is a safer method when multiple
        clients are interacting with <application>MPD</application>.

              Change events accumulate, even while the connection is
              not in "idle" mode; no events gets lost while the client
              is doing something else with the connection.  If an
              event had already occurred since the last call, the new

              While a client is waiting for <command>idle</command>
              results, the server disables timeouts, allowing a client
              to wait for events as long as mpd runs.  The
              <command>idle</command> command can be canceled by
              sending the command <command>noidle</command> (no other
              commands are allowed). <application>MPD</application>
              will then leave <command>idle</command> mode and print
              results immediately; might be empty at this time.

The songs need to have MixRamp tags added by an external tool. 0dB is the normalized maximum volume so use negative values, I prefer -17dB. In the absence of mixramp tags crossfading will be used. See http://sourceforge.net/projects/mixramp

        A "storage" provides access to files in a directory tree.  The
        most basic storage plugin is the "local" storage plugin which
        accesses the local file system, and there are plugins to
        access NFS and SMB servers.

      <para>
        Multiple storages can be "mounted" together, similar to the
        <application>mount</application> command on many operating
        systems, but without cooperation from the kernel.  No
        superuser privileges are necessary, beause this mapping exists
        only inside the <application>MPD</application> process

      <para>
        "Stickers"<footnoteref linkend="since_0_15"/> are pieces of
        information attached to existing
        <application>MPD</application> objects (e.g. song files,
        directories, albums).  Clients can create arbitrary name/value
        pairs.  <application>MPD</application> itself does not assume
        any special meaning in them.
      </para>

      <para>
        The goal is to allow clients to share additional (possibly
        dynamic) information about songs, which is neither stored on
        the client (not available to other clients), nor stored in the
        song files (<application>MPD</application> has no write
        access).

        names, to ensure interoperability.
      </para>

      <para>
        Objects which may have stickers are addressed by their object
        type ("song" for song objects) and their URI (the path within

        Clients can communicate with each others over "channels".  A
        channel is created by a client subscribing to it.  More than
        one client can be subscribed to a channel at a time; all of
        them will receive the messages which get sent to it.
      </para>

      <para>
        Each time a client subscribes or unsubscribes, the global idle
        event <varname>subscription</varname> is generated.  In
        conjunction with the <link
        linkend="command_channels"><command>channels</command></link>
        command, this may be used to auto-detect clients providing
        additional services.
