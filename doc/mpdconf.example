# An example configuration file for MPD
# See the mpd.conf man page for a more detailed description of each parameter.

# Required files and directories ##############################################
#
# This setting controls the top directory which MPD will search to discover the
# available audio files and add them to the daemon's online database.
#
music_directory			"~/music"
#
# This setting sets the MPD internal playlist directory. The purpose of this
# directory is storage for playlists created by MPD. The server will use 
# playlist files not created by the server but only if they are in the MPD
# format.
#
playlist_directory		"~/.mpd/playlists"
#
# This setting sets the location of the MPD database. This file is used to
# load the database at server start up and store the database while the 
# server is not up.
#
db_file				"~/.mpd/database"
# 
# These settings are the locations for the daemon log files for the daemon.
# These logs are great for troubleshooting, depending on your log_level
# settings.
#
# The special value "syslog" makes MPD use the local syslog daemon.
# On most systems, log messages will appear in /var/log/daemon.log
# then.
#
log_file			"~/.mpd/log"
###############################################################################


# Optional files ##############################################################
#
# This setting sets the location of the file which stores the process ID
# for use of mpd --kill and some init scripts. This setting is disabled by
# default.
#
#pid_file			"~/.mpd/pid"
#
# This setting sets the location of the file which contains information about
# most variables to get MPD back into the same general shape it was in before
# it was brought down. This setting is disabled by default.
#
#state_file			"~/.mpd/state"
#
###############################################################################


# General music daemon options ################################################
#
# This setting specifies the user that MPD will run as, if set. MPD should
# never run as root and you may use this setting to make MPD change its user 
# id after initialization. Do not use this setting if you start MPD as an
# unprivileged user. This setting is disabled by default, and the server will
# run as root.
#
#user				"nobody"
#
# This setting sets the address for the daemon to listen on. Careful attention
# should be paid if this is assigned to anything other then the default, any.
# This setting can deny access to control of the daemon.
#
# For network
#bind_to_address		"any"
#
# And for Unix Socket
#bind_to_address		"~/.mpd/socket"
#
# This setting is the port that is desired for the daemon to get assigned to.
#
#port				"6600"
#
# This setting controls the type of information which is logged. Available 
# setting arguments are "default", "secure" or "verbose". The "verbose" setting
# argument is recommended for troubleshooting, though can quickly stretch
# available resources on limited hardware storage.
#
#log_level			"default"
#
# If you have a problem with your MP3s ending abruptly it is recommended that 
# you set this argument to "no" to attempt to fix the problem. If this solves
# the problem, it is highly recommended to fix the MP3 files with vbrfix
# (available from <http://www.willwap.co.uk/Programs/vbrfix.php>), at which
# point gapless MP3 playback can be enabled.
#
#gapless_mp3_playback			"yes"
#
# This setting enables MPD to create playlists in a format usable by other
# music players.
#
#save_absolute_paths_in_playlists	"no"
#
# This setting defines a list of tag types that will be extracted during the 
# audio file discovery process. Optionally, 'comment' can be added to this
# list.
#
#metadata_to_use	"artist,album,title,track,name,genre,date,composer,performer,disc"
#
###############################################################################

# Symbolic link behavior ######################################################
#
# If this setting is set to "yes", MPD will discover audio files by following 
# symbolic links outside of the configured music_directory.
#
#follow_outside_symlinks	"yes"
#
# If this setting is set to "yes, MPD will discover audio files by following
# symbolic links inside of the configured music_directory.
#
#follow_inside_symlinks		"yes"
#
###############################################################################

# Zeroconf / Avahi Service Discovery ##########################################
#
# If this setting is set to "yes", service information will be published with
# Zeroconf / Avahi.
#
#zeroconf_enabled		"yes"
#
# The argument to this setting will be the Zeroconf / Avahi unique name for
# this MPD server on the network.
#
#zeroconf_name			"Music Player"
#

#
# If this setting is set, MPD will require password authorization. The password
# can setting can be specified multiple times for different password profiles.
#
#password                        "password@read,add,control,admin"
#

# Audio Output ################################################################
#
# MPD supports various audio output types, as well as playing through multiple 
# audio outputs at the same time, through multiple audio_output settings 
# blocks. Setting this block is optional, though the server will only attempt
# autodetection for one sound card.
#
# See <http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Configuration#Audio_Outputs> for examples of 
# other audio outputs.
#
# An example of an ALSA output:

#
#audio_output {
#	type			"pulse"
#	name			"My Pulse Output"
#	server			"remote_server"
#	sink			"remote_server_sink"
#}
#
## An example of a null output (for no audio output):
#
#audio_output {
#	type			"null"
#	name			"My Null Output"
#}
#
# This setting will change all decoded audio to be converted to the specified
# format before being passed to the audio outputs. By default, this setting is
# disabled.
#
#audio_output_format		"44100:16:2"
#
# If MPD has been compiled with libsamplerate support, this setting specifies 
# the sample rate converter to use.  Possible values can be found in the

# setting is disabled.
#
#samplerate_converter		"Fastest Sinc Interpolator"
#
###############################################################################


# Volume control mixer ########################################################
#
# MPD has limited volume controls, to use them pick one below. If one is not
# specified it may be autodetected at startup, depending on the dependencies
# which were compiled into the server.
#
# An example for controlling an ALSA or OSS mixer:
#
#mixer_type			"hardware"
#
# This example is a general volume control mixer, it is used to adjust the 
# volume of the audio sent to the audio output, and will work with all outputs.
#
#mixer_type			"software"
#
###############################################################################


# Normalization automatic volume adjustments ##################################
#
# This setting specifies the type of ReplayGain to use. This setting can have
# the argument "album" or "track". See <http://www.replaygain.org> for more
# details. By default this setting is disabled.
#
#replaygain			"album"
#
# This setting sets the pre-amp used for files that have ReplayGain tags. By
# default this setting is disabled.
#
#replaygain_preamp		"0"
#
# This setting enables on-the-fly normalization volume adjustment. This will
# result in the volume of all playing audio to be adjusted so the output has 
# equal "loudness".
#
#volume_normalization		"no"
#
###############################################################################


# MPD Internal Buffering ######################################################
#
# This setting adjusts the size of internal decoded audio buffering. Changing
# this may have undesired effects. Don't change this if you don't know what you
# are doing.
#
#audio_buffer_size		"2048"
#
# This setting controls the percentage of the buffer which is filled before 
# beginning to play. Increasing this reduces the chance of audio file skipping, 
# at the cost of increased time prior to audio playback.
#
#buffer_before_play		"10%"
#
###############################################################################


# HTTP Streaming Proxy ########################################################
#
# This setting specifies the HTTP proxy to use for playing HTTP streams. By
